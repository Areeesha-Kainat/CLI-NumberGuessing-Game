CLI Number Guessing Game :
Project Description:
The CLI Number Guessing Game is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) game where users have to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, encouraging users to refine their guesses and find the correct number as efficiently as possible. This project is an excellent demonstration of basic programming concepts, including input handling, control structures, and random number generation.

Features:
Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number within a user-defined range.
User Feedback: Provides real-time feedback to guide the user if their guess is too high or too low.
Guess Counter: Tracks the number of attempts the user takes to guess the correct number.
Technology:
TypeScript: This project is implemented using TypeScript, leveraging its type safety and modern JavaScript features to create a robust and maintainable codebase.
